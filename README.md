## Overview
![good evaluation](/images/good_2.png) ![good evaluation](/images/bad_answer.png) 

This Anki add-on enhances your flashcard review experience by providing intelligent AI-powered analysis of your answers. Instead of just showing whether your answer matches the expected one, the AI evaluates the quality of your response and provides constructive feedback to help you learn more effectively.

‚ö†Ô∏è : This add-on works with Anki's type-answer question-answer.

## Purpose

### What it does:
- **Intelligent Answer Evaluation**: AI analyzes your answers semantically, not just text matching
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provides specific tips to improve your understanding
- **Smart Review Suggestions**: Recommends appropriate review intervals based on answer quality
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works in English, French, Spanish, and German
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Choose from OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, DeepSeek, openrouter or Groq
‚ö†Ô∏è : I tested Google Gemini and OpenRouter using their free evaluation keys.

### Why use it:
- **Better Learning**: Get personalized feedback on why your answer was right or wrong
- **Semantic Understanding**: AI recognizes when your answer is conceptually correct even if worded differently
- **Efficiency**: Focus more time on concepts you struggle with
- **Motivation**: Positive reinforcement when you're improving
